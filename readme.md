A quick demo of the v0.3.0 API of [chenglou/react-motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion). Implements component unmounting with a transition. The reason this is interesting is because it neatly handles the component unmounting problem, which if you use React know can be tricky to deal with when it comes to animation.
